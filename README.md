A Basic Solar System Simulation
- First WebGL Project, helps with understanding rotation, translation in WebGL/Three.js better, as well as shaders/GLSL.

TODOS:
- Find a better way to draw the sun, such as using the shader below
- Fix the rendering of the rings, so the pattern goes in the proper direction
- Figure out how to draw stars in the background
- Figure out how to draw asteroids
- Enable explorer camera controls (FlyControls)
- Add datGui menu for controlling zoom, camera, lighting, and other settings

Orbit Calculations:
- Earth   = 500 pixels (93 million miles)
- Mercury = Earth * .38   = 190 (36 million miles)
- Venus   = Earth * .72   = 360 (67.2 million miles)
- Mars    = Earth * 1.52  = 760 (141.6 million miles)
- Jupiter = Earth * 5.20  = 2600 (483.6 million miles)
- Saturn  = Earth * 9.53  = 4765 (886.7 million miles)
- Uranus  = Earth * 19.18 = 9590 (1784.0 million miles)
- Neptune = Earth * 30.04 = 15020 (2794.4 million miles)
- Pluto   = Earth * 39.51 = 19755  (3674.5 million miles)
